# Gender Recognition through Face using Deep Learning
* Developed a deep learning model to recognize gender from face images with high accuracy by using deep learning
frameworks (TensorFlow, Keras),Convolutional neural networks (CNNs),Face detection and preprocessing libraries
(OpenCV).
* Utilized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to extract features from face images and classify
them as male or female and achieved 100 percent accuracy
